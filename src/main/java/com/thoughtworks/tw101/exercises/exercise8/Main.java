// Exercise #8: Create a new version of Exercise #7 where you also record all of the userâ€™s guesses and print them out
// once they guess correctly. Use an ArrayList to store the guesses. Catch the NumberFormatException and handle the case
// where the user entered a String that is not parseable.
